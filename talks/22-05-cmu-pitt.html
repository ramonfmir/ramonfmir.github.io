/-  # Verified Optimization # 
This is the continuation of Alex's talk last week. I'll focus on how to solve 
the optimization problem once it's been transformed and reduced to conic form. 
First, let's recall a couple of things. What was the idea?
We start with problems that look like:
    minimize          cᵀx
    subject to   exp(y) ≤ log(a√x + b)
                ax + by = d
Then apply the `dcp` tactic and end up with a conic optimization problem:
    minimize          cᵀx
    subject to      Ax = b
                Gx - h ∈ K <-- 🍦
Now we can call an external solver and get a result. We will illustrate how to
do that using an example. We will only look at semidefinite programs today.

#print PSDCone -- M ∈ 𝒫 ↔ ∀x. xᵀMx ≥ 0 ↔ M = LᵀL

/- **Semidefinite Programming**
We have the following problem:
    minimize       ⟨C, X⟩
    subject to   ⟨A, X⟩ = b
                    X ≽ 0
Notes:
* New syntax following last week's suggestions.
* Attribute `optimizationParam`.

    minimize posDefObjective C X
    subject to 
      A : affineConstraint A X b
      P : PSDCone X

/- **Conic Benchmark Form (CBF)**
The first step to find a solution is to convert it to a format that a convex
optimization solver can understand. In our case, we will use MOSEK.
Notes:
* See `solver/test.cbf`.

Now we send it to MOSEK and get a solution back.

/- **Generating the Certificate**
The dual of `problem` is the following optimization problem:
    maximize        yb
    subject to  C = yA + Z
                  Z ≽ 0
If the primal problem is feasible and bounded, MOSEK will give us a feasible 
point (y, Z).
Theorem [Weak Duality]. If X is primal-feasible and (y, Z) is dual-feasible, 
then yb ≤ ⟨C, X⟩
Proof.
    ⟨C, X⟩ = tr(C ⬝ X)
       ... = tr((yA + Z) ⬝ X)           
       ... = y tr(A ⬝ X) + tr(Z ⬝ X) 
       ... = y ⟨A, X⟩ + ⟨Z, X⟩
       ... = yb + ⟨Z, X⟩
    We have that ⟨Z, X⟩ ≥ 0 as Z, X ≽ 0. Therefore, yb ≤ ⟨C, X⟩. ∎
Theorem [Strong Duality]. If, moreover ⟨C, X⟩ ≤ yb, then the X is an optimal 
solution.
Proof.
    If X' is any other feasible point, by weak duality, yb ≤ ⟨C, X'⟩. By 
    assumption (and le_trans) it follows that ⟨C, X⟩ ≤ ⟨C, X'⟩. ∎
The certificate consists of a primal-feasible point X, a dual-feasible point 
(y, Z) such that ⟨C, X⟩ ≤ yb.

/- **The `sdp_solve` Tactic**
Putting everything together:
    `Minimization` --> `SDPForm` --> `CBF` - MOSEK -> `Sol` --> `Solution` 
Feasibility checks are performed with floats using epsilon-equality. For PSD 
constraints, we use Choleksy. They are all proved by `nativeDecide`.
Notes:
* We cheat! The certificate is checked but `Certificate.toSolution` is sorry'd.
* Also try C = [[1,1],[1,0]].

/- **Reals and Floats**
The `realToFloat` procedure takes "any" real-valued expression and gives us its 
floating-point equivalent.

/- **Conclusion and Future Work** 
The priority right now is to make sure that any conic program can be encoded. 
The next question is: what do we do with the certificate? There are different 
levels of rigour:
0. Do nothing, trust the solver.
1. Check that things are almost equal and almost PSD (some theory needed here).
2. Small axiomatization of errors introduced by float operations + lemmas.
3. Full formalization of IEEE standard (volunteers?) + many lemmas.
We're currently at 0.5. With rigour = 1, we wouldn't have a proof but we could 
give some confidence interval and bounds. With rigour ≥ 2, we could have 
something like ValidSDP (https://github.com/validsdp/validsdp).
If the problem is rational, there are tricks to recover rational certificates 
from the floating point certificate.
